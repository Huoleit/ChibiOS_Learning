By Yang Shaohui, Alex Au on 2018.09.13

## Getting started on Unix
run the following commands in the project directory
1.  For Linux, ubuntu to be exact:
    `sudo apt-get install openocd gcc-arm-none-eabi`

    For Mac OSX, do the following: install homebrew first via https://brew.sh

    then install the XCode command line toolchain `xcode-select --install`

    `brew cask install xquartz java`

    `brew install open-ocd`

    `brew tap PX4/px4`

    `brew install px4-dev`

2. `git clone https://github.com/robomasterhkust/RMTutorialF103` and
`cd RMTutorialF103` in your preferred directory

4. `make` or `make -j4` where 4 is the thread count

5. run `openocd -f openocd/start_st-link_flash.cfg` with board connected via st-link to flash the program
---
#### Optional:
- for debugging, run `openocd -f openocd/start_st-link_debug.cfg` , followed by a gdb connection with you own IDE/editor, the VSCode configuration is provided and is used with the "Native Debug" extension
- of course you can always use `telnet localhost 4444` and use terminal to interface with the openocd debug server directly

## Submitting assignments
This part will come up later on.
